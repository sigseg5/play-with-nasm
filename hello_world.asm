; EQU defines a symbol to a given constant value:
; when EQU is used, the source line must contain a label.
; The action of EQU is to define the given label name to the value of its (only) operand.
; This definition is absolute, and cannot change later.

; defines 'msglen' to be the constant 12
; $ is the address of the current position before emitting the bytes (if any) for the line it appears on.
; '$ - msglen' is like doing here - msg,
; i.e. the distance in bytes between the current position (at the end of the string)
; and the start of the string.
